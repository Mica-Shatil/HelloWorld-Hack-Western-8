# HelloWorld
The world is filled with language barriers making it extremely difficult to talk to people who speak different languages. We wanted to eliminate language barriers so anyone can talk with anyone. We also noticed that there was a lack of translation apps to translate languages in real time, so we wanted to create a program to translate languages in realtime, in-person and on the Internet. This is exactly what HelloWorld can do!
